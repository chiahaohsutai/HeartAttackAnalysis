## Heart Attack Analysis

This project focuses in building a classification model which can detect whether a patient is at a high risk of a heart attack. 

A detailed description of the project can be found on the notebook provided. I have also included a project proposal file which details the 
reasons we are building a classification model for heart disease patients.

Please refer to those files in order to gain an understanding of the project and its purpose.
